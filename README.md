### Capacitated K-Center on NYC 911 EMS Data

This repository explores clustering methods for **emergency facility location optimization** in New York City.  
The project investigates how **capacity constraints** (like limited ambulances per station) affect traditional clustering objectives such as *K-Center*  to handle them efficiently.
---
## Overview
Emergency response systems rely on locating service centers optimally to minimize response time.  
However, real-world centers have **limited capacity** — each can handle only a certain number of incidents.  

This project:
- Analyzes NYC 911 EMS incident data.
- Implements **Capacitated K-Center** algorithm.
- Visualizes cluster assignments on a city map using **GeoPandas** and **Folium**.
