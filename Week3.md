**Week 3**

This week, I started to focus on the constrained (capacitated) version of the K-Center problem. I read about how capacity limits make the problem more like real-world situations, where each facility can only handle a certain number of requests. The paper I read talked about different ways to deal with this, such as approximation methods and flow-based checks.

At the same time, I read the research paper on Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) for finding the best place for ambulances to be in case of a road accident. It was interesting because it used both old and new ideas about where to put facilities. The paper presented ambulance siting not merely as a geometric challenge, but as a scenario enhanced by the integration of high-dimensional features and deep learning into a context where clustering gains significance. It taught me how to use more advanced models to make traditional algorithms like K-Center work with messy, real-world data like accident locations, road networks, and contextual features.
