This two week, I continued work on the data clustering experiments and ran the full code in Google Colab. The setup now successfully loads the cleaned NYC 911 dataset, performs preprocessing, and visualizes clusters interactively using Folium. I focused on refining the k-center and k-means implementations efficiency for different *k* values.

I  synced with my professor  and met him biweekly on zoom at 3 pm PST bi-weekly to review progress, discuss, and plan the next phase.
